# My Solution to Software Foundations

This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey through the Software Foundations series, a collection of exercises and concepts in formal verification, functional programming, and programming language theory. 

Each exercise is completed independently to ensure a deep and meaningful understanding of the material. 

I believe that tackling these challenges on my own fosters a stronger grasp of the underlying principles and enhances my problem-solving skills.
